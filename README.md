# Coursera Course Dataset Analysis

## Overview

The "coursera_courses.ipynb" Jupyter notebook in this project explores the Coursera Course Dataset, aiming to gain insights into the usage patterns and preferences of Coursera users. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle at [Coursera Course Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharthm1698/coursera-course-dataset), provides information about various courses available on the Coursera platform.

## Dependencies

The project relies on: 

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

The following Python modules are used in this analysis:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Data manipulation and analysis library.
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/): Library for numerical operations in Python.
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): Data visualization library based on matplotlib.

See requirements.txt for full description and versions of dependencies 

## Analysis Highlights

The analysis includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Coursera Course Dataset.
- Creation of visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify popular and well-rated courses.
- Assessment of user demographics and preferences.

### Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment using the requirements.txt file provided<br>
   e.g. 
```bash
python3 -m venv coursera_courses/
# activate the venv and install all requirements provided 
source coursera_courses/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook file, coursera_courses.ipynb, in your Jupyter environment.

## Usage

To reproduce the analysis:<br>
Open the "coursera_courses.ipynb" Jupyter notebook and run the notebook cells to execute the analysis and generate visualizations.

## Project Objectives

The analysis is driven by two primary questions:

1. **What do people commonly use the Coursera platform for?**

2. **Who is the typical Coursera user?**

The project seeks to understand the popularity and user satisfaction of Coursera courses, ultimately addressing the broader question: _"Does Coursera effectively reach its target audience?"_

## Hypothesis and Rationale

### Working Hypothesis:

Our team predicts that Coursera is predominantly used for continuing and supplemental education, particularly by individuals pursuing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.

### Rationale:

STEM fields often require specialized training, and engagement with experts through platforms like Coursera is essential for proper skill development. Furthermore, STEM-related certifications are valuable in the job market, making Coursera a likely choice for those seeking relevant training.

## Conclusion

The findings from this analysis aim to provide insights into Coursera's effectiveness in reaching its target audience. By understanding popular courses and user demographics, the project contributes to evaluating Coursera's impact on online education.
